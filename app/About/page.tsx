          <p>
            I am a full stack developer with a focus on the front end. Over my years of learning programming, I
            have learned my languages from C, C++, Basic, Python and Java just to name a few. I also have an expertise
            of web technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript (ES6 & Typescript) to create web applications and APIs.

            I always am looking to learn the latest technologies and practices to improve my code and the projects
            I dedicate my time to.
